# HackUCI2023
Project for Hack@UCI 2023!

The overall aim of our project is to create a website that advises users on what other people commonly use.   
For example, let's say that you wanted to create a chess game. What programming language do you choose to write the code in? What platform do most people use? Our project aims to answer all those questions for you (or at least a good majority of them) so that you can quickly get started on whatever you want to create!
